# List tables to avoid for NL->SQL generation (guardrails/sensitive data).
# Populate `tables` with fully qualified names or catalog/schema/table parts.
#
# Examples:
# - catalog: hive
#   schema: reco_prod
#   table: pii_users
#   reason: Contains personally identifiable information
#
# - catalog: hive
#   schema: finance
#   table: payments_raw
#   reason: Raw payments data; restricted access
#
# Use lowercase to match typical Trino identifiers, and add as many entries as needed.

tables: []
