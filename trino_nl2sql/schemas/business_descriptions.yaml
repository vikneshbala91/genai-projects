# Business Context for Trino Tables
# This file provides business descriptions and context for your database tables and columns
# The actual schema (tables, columns, data types) is fetched dynamically from Trino
# Only add entries here for tables/columns that need additional business context

# Note: You don't need to specify 'database' - it comes from TRINO_CATALOG.TRINO_SCHEMA in .env

tables:
  # Example: Add business descriptions for your tables
  # - name: your_table_name
  #   description: Business description of what this table represents
  #   columns:
  #     - name: column_name
  #       description: Business meaning of this column (e.g., "User's primary email for login")

  # You can add descriptions for specific columns you want to clarify
  # - name: transactions
  #   description: Contains all financial transactions processed by the system
  #   columns:
  #     - name: amount
